## Python experiments

In this repository you can find several packages/modules that
I create while learning python

use_c_dll and use_c_plus_plus_dll are experiments to play with the various ways
of calling c/c++ code from python. I used Visual Studio Code and the mingw64 toolchain
to compile the .dll's used. Extensions needed are:
* C/C++ by Microsoft
* CMakeTools by vector-of-bool

Note to self: ctypes, CFFI, Cython cppyy SWIG Boost.Python, pyrex ....
